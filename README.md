# GoHome
GoHome is a tool which motivates you to go home and live your life (LOL!) 
Well it reminds you to close the work and go home after completion of working hours.

# Configuring the timeout time

- Use `-h` flag to configure the hours to set
- Use `-m` flag to configure the mins to set
- Use `-message` flag to configure the message to show on completion of working hours

Example:

`main -h 1 -m 30` sets the timer for 1 hour and 30 minutes
`main -h 1 -m 30 -message "Go"` sets the timer for 1 hour and 30 minutes and shows dialog with the given message

# Usage (Newbiees)

## For Windows
Put the `main.exe` in "Startup" folder to run the program on booting your machine

# Building (Experts)
